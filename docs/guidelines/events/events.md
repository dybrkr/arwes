When an external factor interacts with nodes in the system (such as user mouse
or keyboard, or real time notification), the nodes can affect themselves, such
as a toggle (changing from on to off and vice-versa), or they can affect a
sub-system, such as expanding information on hover or transitioning to another
system.

For subtle interactions, like hovering a node or typing a key, subtle animations
and sounds can be played. These should not bring too much attention.

For decisive interactions, like selecting an option or typing enter, more concise
animations and sounds can be played. These should bring attention.
